I am a junior at [Princeton University](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) studying Applied Mathematics & Computer Science. I am interested in machine learning, optimization, and bioengineering!

I am currently working as a Data & Analytics Research Intern at [JPMorganChase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), where I am building data infrastructure for ML Ops.

I have previosly worked in the [Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance](https://niehaus.princeton.edu/) under Professor [Duy Trinh](https://duydtrinh.com/), optimizing dataset querying for economic research. Additionally, I was a research intern at the [Ludwig Cancer Institute](https://ludwigcancer.princeton.edu/), searching for links between diet and breast cancer cell metastasis in the [Tissue Morphodynamics Lab](https://cmngroup.princeton.edu/) under Professor [Celeste Nelson](https://cmngroup.princeton.edu/Celeste.htm).

You can reach me at `williamoh [at] princeton [dot] edu`.
